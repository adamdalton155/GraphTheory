<h2>Welcome to my Graph Theory repeat repository</h2>
<h4>Within this repository you will see an explanation for what is in the two notebooks, why the repository exists and how to run the notebooks</h4>
<h4>- What is in this repository? -</h4>

Within this repository there are two Jupyter Notebooks named Heap-Sort and Graph Isomorphism. Both of these notebooks are run through Jupyter Notebook

<h4>- Why does this reposiotry exist? -</h4>

This repository exists as a host for my work regarding research about Heap-Sort and Graph Isomorphism. The Heap-Sort notebook serves to discuss four topics based on my research

<ul>
    <li>Explanation of what a rooted binary tree is</li>
    <li>Overview of how the heap sort algorithm works, with reference to trees.</li>
    <li>Python function implementing Heap Sort.</li>
    <li>Explanation why, in the worst case, heap sort is more efficient than bubble sort.
</li>
</ul>

Like the Heap-Sort notebook, the Graph Isomorphism notebook also discusses four topics based on my research
<ul>
    <li>Definition of graph isomorphism</li>
    <li>Specification of the Graph Isomorphism Problem</li>
    <li>Python function to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic</li>
    <li>Explanation of the main reason computer scientists are interested in the complexity of the Graph Isomorphism Problem</li>

</ul>
<h4>- How to run these notebooks -</h4>
To run these notebooks you must have Python installed. Then open a terminal/command prompt window and install Jupyter Notebook by running the 
command pip install notebook. After installation, create a folder anywhere on your Mac/PC, open a terminal/command prompt on that folder and run this command 
git clone https://github.com/adamdalton155/GraphTheoryRepeat Once that has completed change directory into the GraphTheoryAssessment 
folder and enter the command jupyter notebook. A localhost window will open on your browser with two files visible. '
heap-sort.ipynb' and 'graph-isomorphism.ipynb'
